This is a work on Dreaddit data set

Main components are as follows:
1. Auto EDA using Pandas profiling
2. BERT tokenizer from Hugging face for tokenizing text data
3. Various models were used and finally GBM, XGBoost and LGBM were used and they almost gave same scores
4. Optuna is used to tune the models
5. Weighted Voting classifier is implemented on above models
